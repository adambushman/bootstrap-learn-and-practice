# Bootstrap Learn and Practice

A series of HTML files for learning and practicing implementation of the Bootstrap CSS framework.

## Description

While custom CSS is a great way to understand the underlying principles and ultimately customize the look and feel of any markup element, often I find myself writing the same styles over and over again, manipulating the end result by only a few percent. I felt it was time to learn and implement a CSS framework in my web development and integrate it into my web dev workflow.

Within this repository you'll find HTML files where I practice using the classes associated with layouts, components, helpers, utilities, and more. I also completed [three projects](https://adambushman.github.io/bootstrap-learn-and-practice/) demonstrating the use of bootstrap.
